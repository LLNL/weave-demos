Ball Bounce
-----------

A demonstration of Sina and Maestro being used together to perform and analyze runs of a toy code that simulates a ball bouncing around in a 3D box. Maestro is used to launch suites of runs, each sharing a ball starting position but having a randomized velocity vector. The toy code outputs DSV, which is converted to Sina's format, ingested, and can then be explored in the included Jupyter notebook.
